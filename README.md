A compliant, robust ActivityPub server in one page

This project has multiple goals. First, it's a demonstration of how to build an ActivityPub server, with most of the important parts implemented. It should be useful for implementers who want to know how ActivityPub works in the real world. Second, it's a platform for testing and experimentation with new client apps and new server features.

## Background

[ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) ("AP") is a decentralized social networking protocol. It uses [Activity Streams 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) ("AS2") as its social data format.

ActivityPub defines a client API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting social data, and a server-to-server for delivering that data to remote servers.

onepage.pub implements as much as possible of the ActivityPub API and protocol in a single JavaScript module. It doesn't use any Activity Streams- or ActivityPub-specific libraries. At 1300+ lines of code, it's not exactly a one-page program, but it's still pretty small.

It is a **headless** server. It includes only a rudimentary Web UI for registration, login, logout, and OAuth 2.0 authorization flow. Everything else is done through the API.

## Install

For now, you have to clone it to a directory.

```
git clone git@github.com:evanp/onepage.pub.git

cd onepage.pub
npm install
```

## Usage

You should be able to run it with Node.js.

```
node index.mjs
```

It takes a few environment variables as configuration options:

- OPP_DATABASE: the path to the SQLite database file for persistent data(default: `:memory:`, no persistence!)
- OPP_HOSTNAME: the hostname of the server (default: `localhost`). Once you
start a server, you can't change this without messing up all your links and
everyone's links to you.
- OPP_PORT: the port to listen on (default: `3000`). Same caveat as above.
- OPP_KEY: path to your SSL private key file (default: `localhost.key`).
- OPP_CERT: path to your SSL certificate file (default: `localhost.cert`).

## API

The server supports the following standards:

- [WebFinger](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7033)
- [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/)
- [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)
- [HTTP Signatures](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-12)

The basic API usage is as follows:

- Manually register a user with `/register`. This will create a user account
  and a WebFinger resource.
- Use WebFinger to find the user's ActivityPub profile. It's listed as an `alternative` link with `type="application/activity+json"`.
- Get the user's profile with an HTTP GET to the profile URL. This will give the user's profile, which includes the `inbox`, `outbox`, `following`, `followers`, and `liked` URLs.
- Use the `outbox` URL to POST new activities to the user's outbox. This will deliver the activity to the user's followers.
- Use the `inbox` URL to read incoming activities for the user.

Note that the URLs for Activity Streams 2.0 objects, including user profiles and related collections, are pretty much random. You can't guess the URL of the user's `inbox` based on their username, for example.

The server implements the expected side effects for the ActivityPub protocol:

- `Follow`
- `Create`
- `Update`
- `Delete`
- `Like`
- `Block`
- `Add`
- `Remove`

## Status

The server is still in development. It's not ready for production use. There is a public GitHub project for tracking a 1.0 release at:
